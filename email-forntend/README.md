Code Structure Overview
1. Types (src/types/email.ts)

Email: Interface for email records with id, recipient, subject, body, attachment name, sent date, and status
EmailFormData: Interface for form input data (to, subject, body, optional attachment file)
2. Email Form (src/components/EmailForm.tsx)

Uses React hooks (useState) to manage form state and submission status
Form validation ensures all required fields (to, subject, body) are filled
File upload handling for attachments with accepted file types (.pdf, .doc, .txt, images)
Success/error notifications using Sonner toast
Clears form after successful submission
Uses shadcn/ui components (Card, Input, Textarea, Button) with Lucide icons
3. Email History (src/components/EmailHistory.tsx)

Displays list of previously sent emails in a scrollable area
Color-coded status badges (green for sent, yellow for pending, red for failed)
Shows email details: subject, recipient, body preview, timestamp, and attachment name
Uses date-fns for date formatting
Responsive design with hover effects
4. Main Page (src/pages/Index.tsx)

Combines EmailForm and EmailHistory components
Manages email state array with mock data for demonstration
Handles form submission by adding new emails to the history
Simulates API delay (1 second) for realistic UX
Responsive grid layout that stacks on mobile, side-by-side on larger screens
The app demonstrates a complete email interface with form submission, validation, file uploads, and history tracking - ready to connect to a backend API.




Project Folder Structure
üìÅ src/ - Source Code Root
Contains all application source code
Standard React convention for separating source from build/config files

üìÅ src/components/ - Reusable Components
Houses all React components that can be reused across pages
EmailForm.tsx & EmailHistory.tsx - Feature-specific components
src/components/ui/ - Design System Components
Contains shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
Provides consistent, themed UI elements across the app
Follows atomic design principles


üìÅ src/pages/ - Route Components
Contains page-level components that correspond to routes
Index.tsx - Main landing page component
NotFound.tsx - 404 error page
Separates routing logic from reusable components


üìÅ src/types/ - TypeScript Definitions
Centralized type definitions and interfaces
email.ts - Email-related type definitions
Ensures type safety and code documentation
Makes types reusable across components


üìÅ src/hooks/ - Custom React Hooks
Custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
use-mobile.tsx, use-toast.ts - Utility hooks
Promotes code reuse and separation of concerns


üìÅ src/lib/ - Utility Functions
Pure utility functions and configurations
utils.ts - Common helper functions (like cn for className merging)
Non-React specific code that can be easily tested


üìÅ public/ - Static Assets
Static files served directly by the web server
robots.txt, favicon.ico - SEO and branding assets
Files accessible via public URLs


üìÑ Root Config Files
tailwind.config.ts - Tailwind CSS configuration
vite.config.ts - Vite build tool configuration
tsconfig.json - TypeScript compiler settings
package.json - Dependencies and scripts
This structure follows separation of concerns, makes code easily maintainable, and follows React best practices for scalable applications.
